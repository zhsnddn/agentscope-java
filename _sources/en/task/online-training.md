# AgentScope Training Extension

## Overview

### Background

Agent developers typically work with open-source models, using fine-tuning methods such as **SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)** and **RFT (Reinforcement Fine-Tuning)** to balance Agent cost, performance, and effectiveness in specific scenarios. This extension helps Agent developers **conveniently and continuously leverage real online interaction data to optimize models and Agents**, establishing a **complete data loop from production to training systems**, enabling **"Agents that get smarter with use"** through online training.

### Online Training

Online Training is a training paradigm that directly utilizes real user interaction data in production or near-production environments to continuously optimize Agent behavior. Unlike traditional Offline Training—which involves collecting historical logs, building static datasets, and training models in isolated environments—online training emphasizes deep coupling with real toolchains and user behavior, achieving a "run, learn, and optimize" closed loop.

#### Key Characteristics

**1. Reuse Production Toolchains**

Agents can directly invoke real tools deployed in production (such as APIs, databases, business systems, etc.) during training, without the need to build simulation environments or write mock tools specifically for training.

**Advantage**: Avoids "training-deployment deviation" (Reality Gap) caused by inconsistencies between mock tools and actual production behavior; significantly reduces integration costs and improves the authenticity and effectiveness of training data.

**2. Support Incremental Learning with Fast Cold Start**

Does not depend on complete historical datasets; Agents can start learning from a small number or even single real interactions, suitable for newly launched Agents or long-tail scenarios, significantly lowering the startup threshold.


#### Constraints

**Safe Support for Read-Only Tools by Default**

Since the training process may involve multiple attempts or replays, directly invoking write-operation tools (such as "place order", "deduct payment", "send message") may cause repeated execution, leading to business risks. Therefore, write operations require additional safeguards through sandbox mechanisms, idempotent design, or manual review. Users need to ensure the safety of the tools used by their Agents.

**Multi-Turn Interaction Scenarios Require Explicit Modeling**

Current mainstream training frameworks natively support single-turn interactions between users and Agents (user asks → Agent responds). In this interaction, Agents can have multiple interactions with LLMs.

For multi-turn dialogues or complex task flows (such as book flight → select seat → payment), developers need to design additional state management, user behavior simulation, or trajectory sampling strategies.


## Architecture


This solution uses Trinity-RFT as the training backend. Trinity-RFT is a general-purpose, flexible, and user-friendly Large Language Model (LLM) Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) framework.

Github: https://github.com/agentscope-ai/Trinity-RFT

Version requirement: v0.4.0 and above

The online training mode decouples three components: Agent Runner, inference service (Explorer), and training service (Trainer):
![Online-Training Architecture](../../imgs/training.svg)
- Agent Runner is responsible for running user Agent applications, processing user requests, and interacting with Explorer through RESTful APIs. This component is implemented, deployed, and managed by users themselves, with no constraints from Trinity-RFT.
- Explorer serves as the inference service, processing requests from Agent Runner, recording trainable data (Experience), and storing data in the database. Explorer provides the following RESTful interfaces for Agent Runner to call:
  - chat: Compatible with standard OpenAI chat completions interface, handling user dialogue requests.
  - feedback: Receives user feedback on Agent responses.
  - commit: Notifies Explorer to submit data to Trainer.
- Trainer serves as the training service, retrieving new training data from the database, training the model, and storing updated model checkpoints in a shared file system for Explorer to use.

Agent Runner, Explorer, and Trainer can be deployed on different servers. Among them, Agent Runner is managed by users themselves, only requiring network connectivity with Explorer and no GPU resources. Explorer and Trainer need to be deployed on GPU servers through Trinity-RFT and must ensure both can access the same shared file system so that model checkpoints saved by Trainer can be read by Explorer.

### Core Features

This solution provides **end-to-end online training** support natively in AgentScope Java, aiming to establish a complete loop from production to model optimization with the following goals:

- **Leverage Real Online Interaction Data**: Agent developers can directly train using real request invocations and tool states from production Agent environments
- **Minimal Setup Experience**: Agent developers only need to provide key training configurations (such as reward functions in RL) to automatically complete execution, data collection, and the entire training process
- **Unified Training Interface Covering Mainstream Optimization Methods**: Native support for supervised fine-tuning (**SFT**), knowledge distillation, and task-specific reinforcement learning algorithms (such as **PPO**), without needing to switch frameworks or depend on other ecosystems

## Quick Start

### Maven Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.agentscope</groupId>
    <artifactId>agentscope-extensions-training</artifactId>
    <version>${agentscope.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
### Define Request Selection Logic

Request selection logic is used to filter out requests that need to be used for training.

#### Built-in Strategies:

**SamplingRateStrategy** - Random sampling. All online requests are filtered by percentage.
```java
TrainingSelectionStrategy strategy = SamplingRateStrategy.of(0.1);  // 10%
```

**ExplicitMarkingStrategy** - Users explicitly mark important requests
```java
TrainingSelectionStrategy strategy = ExplicitMarkingStrategy.create();

// In your application code, explicitly mark requests for training
TrainingContext.mark("high-quality", "user-feedback");
agent.call(msg).block();  // This request will be used for training
```
#### Custom Strategy
You can implement the TrainingSelectionStrategy interface by referring to SamplingRateStrategy or ExplicitMarkingStrategy, and customize your request filtering logic in the shouldSelect method according to your business needs.


### Define Reward Function
You can implement the RewardCalculator interface and customize your reward calculation logic in the calculate method according to your business needs. Generally, rewards are decimals between 0 and 1.

#### Start Training Backend Environment
Before starting Explorer and Trainer services, you need to start the Ray cluster
```bash
ray start --head
```
Start Explorer and Trainer services separately.

```bash
trinity run --config explorer.yaml
trinity run --config trainer.yaml
```
After starting the Explorer service, the service address will be printed in the log, typically on port 8010
### Configure Online Training and Start Agent

#### Configuration Options

```java
TrainingRunner trainingRunner = TrainingRunner.builder()
        .trinityEndpoint(TRINITY_ENDPOINT) // Trinity Explorer service address
        .modelName(TRAINING_MODEL_NAME)    // Corresponds to model_path in Trinity configuration
        .selectionStrategy(new CustomStrategy())
        .rewardCalculator(new CustomReward())
        .commitIntervalSeconds(60*5)
        .repeatTime(1)
        .build();
trainingRunner.start();
```

#### Complete Example

```java
import io.agentscope.core.training.runner.TrainingRunner;
import io.agentscope.core.training.strategy.SamplingRateStrategy;

// 1. Start training runner (no Task ID/Run ID needed!)
TrainingRunner runner = TrainingRunner.builder()
        .trinityEndpoint("http://trinity-backend:8010")
        .modelName("/path/to/qwen-model")  
        .selectionStrategy(SamplingRateStrategy.of(0.1))  // 10% sampling
        .rewardCalculator(agent -> 0.0)  // Custom reward calculation logic
        .commitIntervalSeconds(300)  // Commit every 5 minutes
        .build();

runner.start();

// 2. Use your Agent normally - training happens transparently!
ReActAgent agent = ReActAgent.builder()
        .name("ProductionAgent")
        .model(gpt4Model)  // Production model (GPT-4)
        .tools(tools)
        .build();

// User requests are processed normally (using GPT-4), 10% automatically sampled for training
Msg response = agent.call(Msg.builder().textContent("Search for Python tutorials").build()).block();

// 3. Stop when training is complete
runner.stop();
```
